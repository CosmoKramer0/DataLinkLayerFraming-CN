# DataLinkLayerFraming-CN
This project demonstrates the simulation of data link layer framing methods using character stuffing in Java. I worked on this project while studying for Computer Networks subject. It includes two Java programs (`stuffed.java` and `stuffing.java`) that perform character stuffing and unstuffing.
